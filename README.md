BatchUserCreator
====================================
BatchUserCreator is a convenient and secure Bash script designed for system administrators or anyone needing to create multiple Linux user accounts efficiently. The script allows you to specify a base username and the number of users to create. For each user, it either assigns a user-provided password or generates a strong random password between 8 to 16 characters, including letters, numbers, and special symbols.

You can also choose whether to create home directories for the users automatically. All generated usernames and their corresponding passwords are saved to a file named users.list for easy reference. This tool helps automate the user provisioning process while maintaining good security practices.
